# four-card-feature-section
 Four card feature section challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io/



<u>Technologies Tried</u>

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 
- Flexbox
- Grid



<u>Issues</u> 

- Aligning the boxes with just Boostrap proved difficult offsetting didn't work
- Positioning the images inside a card component didn't work when back to a plain div and then styled as required
- Full screen a div, did this for the HTML, Body and container div/
- Using bootstrap and flexbox for this doesn't seem to be working. No padding between the boxes and now won't align correctly using off. Considering learning CSS grid to overcome this challenge.
